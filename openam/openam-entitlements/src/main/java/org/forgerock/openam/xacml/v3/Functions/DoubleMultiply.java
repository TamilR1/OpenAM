urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:double-multiply
functions SHALL take two arguments of the specified data-type, integer, or double,
and SHALL return an element of integer or double data-type, respectively.
However, the “add” and “multiply” functions MAY take more than two arguments.
Each function evaluation operating on doubles SHALL proceed as specified
by their logical counterparts in IEEE 754 [IEEE754].
For all of these functions, if any argument is "Indeterminate",
then the function SHALL evaluate to "Indeterminate".
In the case of the divide functions, if the divisor is zero, then the function SHALL evaluate to “Indeterminate”.
This function MUST accept two or more arguments.
